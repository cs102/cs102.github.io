Or Don't as always your choice, the web by nature is a complex system (insert simple explanation about how the net works) over the years it has evolved into what we have today.

The Problem
===========

Too many useless tools and frameworks! to write simple HTML pages that you never going to update again. Mock me if you most, maybe you are thinking you will add something revolutionary later... you won't; not because you can't or you aren't creative. The problem is we are adding unnecessary complexity to a simple problems.

There is no need to use heavy frameworks like Rails, Django, React, etc...to write a personal blog, it's wasteful at best. Don't misunderstand there is a use for this heavy frameworks. We are using jackhammers instead of hammers to complete a task. Learn wha'ts the best toold for the job.

The web has become the dupping grounds of code mediocrity. Our main focus as programmers should be performance! making the web faster and more accesible to everyone in globe, as designers the web more legible too everyone and I mean everyone with special needs the most, because they will more connected to the world.
